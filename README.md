The main function of this project is to read ocean remote sensing data packets, select waveband images based on the user's interest features. At the same time, in order to facilitate the subsequent product extraction of the concerned values, it provides natural true-color pictures and coastline detection images linearly stretched and output directly, Gaussian filtering, Fourier filtering, median filtering, histogram equalization, adaptive histogram equalization, sharpening and other remote sensing image processing methods; And considering that the elements to be extracted may be at the intersection of two remote sensing images or in a smaller
